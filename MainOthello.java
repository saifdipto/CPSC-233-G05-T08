import java.util.Scanner;

// main class
// should control logic of the game and coordinate with graphics
// ask the user whether they want to play with the computer or the user
// create board object(FROM BOARD CLASS)
// prints out starting board with 4 pieces in the middle (FROM BOARD CLASS)
// prints out which players turn it is (generated randomly) (using Math.Random) //ONLY RUNS ONCE IN THE BEGINNING
// main method controls the turns
// create the scanner such that player can put in the x coordinate and the y coordinate which will translate to the location in the board array
        // do code sanitation to check whether the move is valid/ within the board
        // print statement indicating that move is not valid
// check for valid moves by the user
        // then CHECK class will check for moves and update the BOARD
